Account determination and support transactions such as sales order processing and purchase order processing are not covered by this blueprint.\nThe basis for this project will be the standard SAP system currently being implemented by exertis. It is assumed that any Controlling process which is not explicitly covered by this document will follow the standard SAP best-practice process.\nSAP will be the single system for Controlling at exertis.",

This is key when calculating margin and when determining price protection claims. The standard SAP solution to this requirement is to activate split valuation by batch in ERP. By turning on this function, each receipt of stock for a material automatically creates a new batch record and a new valuation type (the two are synonymous). A specific stock value is stored in the system for each valuation type, thus providing similar functionality to the existing Oracle layer costing solution. The drawback with this solution from exertis' perspective is that stock has to be handled in batches. For operational efficiency reasons, the business has decided that the warehouse must be able to work without the need to handle batches.",

When profit centre accounting is activated within the Controlling module, having a DUMMY profit centre is mandatory otherwise postings will completely fail if the system does not have this default when it is unable to derive the correct profit centre.

For exertis this product-based determination is not sufficient and the userexit provided by SAP will be used to determine a profit centre based on the exertis specific logic. In order to facilitate this determination, and also to provide the ability for the order line to have the correct sales rep determined, a new table will be maintained that will store the relationship between a customer, a product, a sales rep and the sales team. This table will be referred to as the Rep Alignment Table The sales team will denote the Profit Centre. For each line item entered into the sales order the following logic will be executed in the profit centre derivation step: Determine the higher level item for the sales line in question and use the material on the higher level item and the customer to access the Rep Alignment Table and return the profit centre If in step 1 we do not have a higher level item then use the material of the sales line and the customer to access the Rep Alignment Table (RAT) and return the Profit Centre. BPC will refer to Success factors to acertain the profit centre. The RAT population programme will then access BPC to get the the profit centre which will in turn be used in the sales order substitution rule. | \n |  |  |  |  | ",
