      "| Process Flow Summary – Step No. | Description of Process | Solution Summary |\n|  |  |  |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 1 | Open the new Materials Management  (MM) period. |\n| Opening the new period in MM will allow postings and changes to be made in the given specific time period, once the new period is open authorised users can post documents in the new period.  The materials period is moved each month and if not completed users will not be able to post material based documents e.g purchase orders, goods receipts even though the financial and controlling periods are open.  The period opening process will be a monthly scheduled job and also closes the prior period | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 2 | Open new accounting period. |\n| Period opening and closing is carried out in Finance as well as in MM.  It should be noted that this is a manual transaction which is carried out and managed by the Finance Department, however it is possible to schedule this process to run automatically Opening the period allows documents such as invoice and credit notes to be posted in the new period.  The Finance periods can be managed by subledger: |\n| A – Assets, D – Customers, K – Vendors, M – Materials, S – G/L Accounts |\n| It is not necessary to follow a specific sequence when opening / closing however logic dictates that Customer (D), Vendors (K) and Materials (M) are closed / opened first then Assets (A) and General Ledger (S) at a later date. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 3 | Maintain Exchange Rates.  |\n| To calculate values such as invoice amounts and transaction costs in different currencies, exertis must maintain appropriate exchange rates.  The system always uses the most up-to-date exchange rate when carrying out currency conversions subject to any fixed rates that may be prevalent in other areas e.g. on Purchase Orders.  Various currencies used by exertis, will be maintained manually using this transaction on a weekly basis. |\n| Exchange rates are maintained using a “valid from“ date. | Configuration:  |\n| Refer to section 7.10 for configuration details. |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 4 | Product cost roll up. |\n| Product cost roll up will be used to update standard costs on Material Master records and will be executed on a monthly basis. This area is documented in the Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes (FIN-06) Blueprint document. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 5 | Provisions & general account posting. |\n| Provisions and GL postings will be made using manual and mass load journals, selecting the appropriate account assignments e.g. Profit Centres, Cost Centres will ensure that these transactions are available in the relevant areas for reporting. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.10 for configuration details. |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 6 | Accruals & Deferrals postings. |\n| This is the processing of accruals. Note that the accruals will have been set up with all the appropriate posting details i.e. GL account, account assignments, amounts as part of the regular system and process maintenance. The accrual posting transactions at month end will be given a unique Document Type so that the postings are easily identifiable in the ledger. They will be automatically reversed in the following period. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.10 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 7 | Post recurring entries.  |\n| This transaction will be used each month to select all the valid recurring journals that have not been posted, and collects them into a batch session, where they are processed automatically.  Prepayments use the recurring entry function where the original posting to a prepayment account is released periodically to the P&L.  Within the header details of a journal the field reference text will be used to record the reason for the recurring journal. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.10 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 8 | GL Account clearing  |\n| Some GL accounts will be created with open item management e.g. those accounts used for Bank Clearing. This will enable the open debit and credit item entries on the account to be matched off against each other. It is necessary to clear outstanding line items in GL accounts at the end of each month so that all items have been correctly identified.   |\n| During clearing, the system enters a clearing document number and the clearing date in these items.  In this way items in a GL account are indicated as cleared.  This can be done manually or automatically.  For automatic clearing, there are numerous criteria which the items can be cleared on e.g. amounts, assignment field, reference field. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.10 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 9 | Vendor account clearing  |\n| In this clearing procedure, open items are selected that balance to zero from an account.  The system then marks these items as cleared.  It enters a clearing document number and the clearing date in the document items.  The clearing date can be the current date or a date that is entered manually.  As with GL, this can be carried out manually or automatically |\n| Users can perform vendor clearing as and when required. However it is good practice to include this step as part of month end process. | Configuration: |\n| Described in the Accounts Payable Blueprint ( FIN-03) |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 10 | Customer account clearing  |\n| Similar to above, customer accounts also need to be maintained to ensure only the actual outstanding line items are shown in the account.  This transaction will be used to clear customer accounts.  As with GL, this can be carried out manually or automatically. |\n|  Users can perform customer clearing as and when required. However it is good practice to include this step as part of month end process. | Configuration: |\n| Described in the Accounts Receivable Blueprint ( FIN-04) |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 11 | Foreign currency valuation |\n| exertis will carry out foreign currency valuation for preparing the financial statements at a key date.  The revaluation will be done monthly and will result in a posting of unrealised gains and losses which will be reversed in the following period.  Valuation is performed at the exchange rate on the valuation date.  The gain or loss is calculated and posted to exchange rate gain/loss accounts.  Unrealised gains and losses will be posted to separate accounts in the general ledger for each of the three ledger types. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.10 for configuration details. |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 12 | AUC Settlements  |\n| Settlement rule for costs is created automatically with assignment to AUC asset.  exertis will perform this settlement each month.  In this process costs are transferred from the P&L to the balance sheet on a periodic basis with a settlement to the final asset once all costs have been incurred and the asset is ready to be commissioned.  Refer to the Asset Management Blueprint document (FIN-05) for further details. | Configuration: |\n| Described in the Asset Accounting Blueprint( FIN-05) |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 13 | Depreciation activities |\n| exertis will carry out depreciation activities to meet accounting requirements. Once carried out depreciation expenses are shown in the P&L account with reference to a cost centre from the asset master, an offset entry to the balance sheet (accumulated depreciation). | Configuration: |\n| Described in the Asset Accounting Blueprint( FIN-05) |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 14 | Cost centre reallocation |\n| At period-end, when all costs have been incurred, cost reallocation processes will be carried out using Distribution.  This will reallocate costs on predefined criteria.  Refer to the Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes Blueprint (FIN-06) for further details. | Configuration: |\n| Described in the  Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes Blueprint (FIN-06). |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 15 | COPA Cost Centre Transfer  |\n| To facilitate the transfer of overhead costs from Cost Centre Accounting into COPA, Assessments will be carried out on predefined criteria. Exertis users will carry out this process after all overhead postings have been carried out.  Refer to the  Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes Blueprint (FIN-06). | Configuration: |\n| Described in the  Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes Blueprint (FIN-06). |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 16 | Production Variances. |\n| Even though this is not a requirement for exertis (as exertis is not a company running full SAP production processes), it is necessary in order to settle production orders, which will be used to facilitate the kititng processes in the warehouse. |\n| Any production orders that are still in W.I.P will be excluded from settlement automatically based on order status. | Configuration: |\n| Described in the  Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes Blueprint (FIN-06). |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – Step 17 | Production Order Settlement. |\n| As part of production order maintenance, production orders will need to be settled. | Configuration: |\n| Described in the  Revenue and Cost Controlling Business Processes Blueprint (FIN-06). |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 18 | Close the Cost Controlling (CO) period. |\n| Once all the CO-related activities have been carried out, the CO period will be closed so that users don’t post new items in the old period.  This is necessary to ensure accuracy in accounting. |\n| Authorised users will have the ability to re-open closed periods. | Configuration:  |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 19 | Intrastat declarations.  |\n| The Intrastat report is a statistical report that includes details of all cross-border flows of goods between EU countries. exertis will create an Intrastat declaration on a monthly bassis as they are required to make declarations of receipts and dispatches for goods traded with other EU countries. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.4 for configuration details. |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 20 | EC Sales List. |\n| Exertis will submit the EC Sales List report as required by HMRC.  This list will contain information on all tax-free goods deliveries and goods movements to registered companies within the European Union in the specified time period. | Configuration:  |\n| Refer to section 7.4 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 -  step 21 | Process VAT return. |\n| This report creates the advance return for tax on sales and/or purchases, and also creates a batch input session for automatic transfer posting of any tax payable. This will allow the users to display the return at item level for each tax type (output and input tax). Exertis users will be able to control the selection of  documents relevant to the VAT return reporting by selecting the posting date, posting period and document date. | Configuration:  |\n| Refer to section 7.4 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 -  step 22 | Fixed asset reconciliation. |\n| This program checks the depreciation postings applied to the fixed asset system reconciled with the updates to the general ledger. | Configuration:  |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 -  step 23 | Close the period in FI & MM  |\n| After completing all the month end activities, periods in AR, AP, Asset Management and GL accounts will be closed.  |\n| It is also necessary to close the period in Materials Management as a part of the period end process. It controls the open period available for users to post items to. MM closing means that users cannot post materials document to the closed period. |\n| Authorised users will have the ability to re-open closed periods. | Configuration:  |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-08.01 – step 24 | Reporting (e.g. trial balance)  |\n| A variety of reports can be executed after finishing month end activities for internal and external purpose. See section 7.2 for a list of the reports which are typically utilised in the month end pocessing. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |",
      "| Process Flow Summary – Step No. | Description of Process | Solution Summary |\n|  |  |  |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 1 | Completion of the period end activities |\n| All the month end activities (reference FIN-08) must be complete before initiating the year end process. | Manual step – no system consideration |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 2 | Open new year and posting period in FI |\n| A new posting period for accounting in FI will be opened.  Opening the period allows documents such as invoice and credit notes to be posted in the new period.  The finance periods can be managed by sub-ledger: |\n| A – Assets ,D – Customers , K – Vendors, M – Materials, S – G/L Accounts |\n| Note that for Year End processing, the four special periods (13 to 16), which are provided as standard by SAP, will be available for Year End adjustments. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 3 | Fiscal year change for Asset Management |\n| A fiscal year change is the opening of a new fiscal year for a Company Code in Asset Management. At the fiscal year change, the asset values from the previous fiscal year are carried forward cumulatively into the new fiscal year. After the fiscal year change the user can post to assets using value dates in the new fiscal year. At the same time, users can also continue to post in the previous fiscal year. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 4 | Provisions and general account posting   |\n| Provisions and GL postings will be made using manual and mass load journal entries. Selecting the appropriate account assignments e.g. Profit Centres, Cost Centres, will ensure that these transactions are available in the relevant areas for reporting. | Configuration: |\n| Refer to section 7.3 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 5 | AR & AP balance carry forward  |\n| In this process the exertis finance department will carry forward account balances into the new fiscal year. The balance to be carried forward is shown in the account balance display. Postings to the current fiscal year do not cause the balance carry forward in the new fiscal year to be updated. For this reason, the balance carry forward routine can be repeated. |\n| Parked documents are either deleted or posted during year end processing. Exertis users will have to ensure all parked documents are actioned appropriately. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 6 | AP balance confirmations  |\n| In this step balance confirmations will be created, this is required as a part of the audit process, to check the accuracy of the accounts payable to vendors. This will enable exertis to detect and correct any discrepancies which may exist between its records and those of the business partners and to make any necessary adjustments. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 7 | AR balance confirmations  |\n| Similar to above, exertis will confirm balances with its customer. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 8 | Fixed Asset reconciliations  |\n| This transaction allows users to produce a comparison report to tie G/L balance with the asset sub-ledger balances. exertis will use this to find any anomalies in the G/L accounts and will also help identify differences between Asset Accounting line items and the balances of the various asset reconciliation accounts. This report will be used if differences occur between the general ledger balance list and the values shown in the asset history sheet. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 9 | Year End close in Asset Management  |\n| The main purpose of the year-end closing in Asset Management is to block the values from prior years from further depreciation calculation. Note that without performing this step, depreciation cannot be calculated in the new fiscal year. |\n| The closing of Asset Accounting will be done before closing any other ledgers. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 10 | Open and close the Cost Controlling (CO) period  |\n| Once all the CO-related activities have been carried out, the CO period will be closed, so that users don’t post new items into the old period.  The new period will also be opened. This is necessary to ensure accuracy in accounting. | Configuration: |\n| N/A |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 11 | Close the period for AR and AP – if this step has not already been completed as part of month end process. | Standard step in manual SAP processing |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 12 | Close the period for GL |\n| This step automatically carries forward the P/L accounts to a retained earnings account – resetting the P/L accounts to zero for the upcoming year. | Standard step in manual SAP processing |\n| FIN-09.01 – step 13 | GR/IR Analysis, Receivables and Payables reclassification  |\n| The program for GR/IR analysis analyses the GR/IR account in order to make reclassification postings which are required in order to display the following business transactions correctly in the balance sheet: |\n| Goods delivered, but not invoiced |\n| Goods invoiced, but not delivered |\n| Where open items per Purchase Order number do not balance out to zero, adjustment postings are created in a batch input session for these items. With a credit balance, the transactions are seen as \"delivered, but not invoiced\". With a debit balance, the transactions are seen as \"invoiced, but not delivered\". |\n| All postings are reversed at the specified reverse posting date. If no date is entered, the program reverses the postings on the day after the key date. |\n| For AR and AP reclassification, the system checks for each debtor and creditor whether the balance should be reclassified as a creditor (based on the customer having a credit balance) or as a debtor (based on the vendor having a debit balance). |\n| These receivables and payables are then reclassified on separate G/L accounts. | Configuration:  |\n| Refer to section 7.11 for configuration details. |\n|   |\n| WRICEF: |\n| N/A |\n| FIN-09.01- Step 14 | Asset history, balance sheet reports  |\n| The asset history sheet displays all changes to the exertis asset portfolio in a fiscal year.  |\n| exertis will use the reporting function to produce standard balance sheet and financial statements. The SAP reports will also be used to see P&L reports.
